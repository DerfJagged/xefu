## Overview
This folder contains configs used in xefutitle7 (most of them). Configs can be renamed to different ID to easily test them on other games. Many configs here are dependent on xefutitle7.xex data, remember to have that file not spoofed to another version.

## More info
Configs which use cfg7/cfg8/cfg11/cfg12/cfg13/cfg14 are region and game dependent, it's a bad idea to use them on different games. Those configs are meant to hit specific memory offsets of Original Xbox games and this offset can be different even per-region of the same title.
While they can be tested, it is strongly suggested to set those commands to 00 00 00 00 first.
