## Overview
Configs 13 and 14 are responsible for marking data in code segments. Xefu recompiler works in 4096 bytes chunks of x86 code, and there is small possibility that recompiler will get data instead of x86 code. This obviously can create many problems. To resolve that developers came up with config that allow mark sections that will be skipped.

## Cfg13
No less no more, cfg13 is just count of cfg14 config sets. Single set is 3 x 4 bytes of data.

## Cfg14
This config holds Original Xbox memory addresses that mark range of skipped data and next address to be recompiled. This need to be confirmed, but it seems logical when last field is 0 then recompilation stops completely (useful for data that is at the end of code segment).

Config data is 3 x 4 bytes and fields are:
1. Start address of data
2. End address of data
3. Next address to recompile

## More Info
On example below you can see parts of data in .text segment of US version of Legacy of Kain: Defiance.

Start of data:
![cfg14_st](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f3d020a-fa08-431c-bf8c-20aad50a4bff)

End of data plus next code:
![cfg14_en](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/57631f5a-39f9-4e62-bc86-3f5adbe0b3b3)

Now comparing that to info from official config for this game we can see clearly that addresses match here: 

```
   CONFIG 13/14 data:
    count: 0x00000001
    XBE skip recomp start: 0x00120500 | XBE skip recomp end: 0x001619F3 | XBE next recomp: 0x001619F4
```
This also means that official config is valid only for US region of game, because EU version of game have data in different region. Please remember that not all unresolved code in disassembler is always to be marked, sometimes it is jump table and emu is able to figure out them without help. Sometimes is just disassembler that missed some code. But usually greater chunks of data turn out to be real data, that should be skipped.
