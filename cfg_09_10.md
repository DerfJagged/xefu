## Overview
Configs 9 and 10 are responsible for recompiler and pipeline emulation setting.

## Cfg9
No less no more, cfg9 is just count of cfg10 config sets. Single set is 4 x 4 bytes of data (this don't include segment name itself).

## Cfg10
This config holds 4 fields with params that change x86 recompilation and x86 pipeline emulation behavior. Each field is explained below.

Config data is 4 x 4 bytes and fields are:
1. Segment name pointer
2. x86 emulation flags
3. x86 emulation flags for secondary dispatch.
4. x86 recompilation flags

### Param 1
Pointer to xbe segment name to which whole config will be applied. 

### Param 2 and 3
Those params are the same bitfields, just param2 is used globally and param3 only during "secondary dispatch". Params are 32bit big endian bitfields.
Default value is 0x1F4FFFFF, and params 2 and 3 are arithmetically anded with this value. Which mean we can't enable any new bits, only disable existing bits from 0x1F4FFFFF. Not much is known about those bits for now, functions which use them are usually heavily related to x86 pipeline emulation or recompiler itself. 

### Param 4
Another bitfield, this time default value is 0 and we enable options by enabling respective bits/values.
* 0x00000001 = Alternative SHLD cl/SHRD cl opcodes handling on recompilation stage
* 0x00000002 = Alternative precompiled handler for MMXPMULLW/MMXPMULHW/MMXPMADDWD opcodes. When enabled, altivec is not used in those operations (could be more accurate due to int operation?).
