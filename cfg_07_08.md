## Overview
Configs 07 and 08 are responsible for patching x86 code at runtime. Emulator use this to fix some issues, but community may known that kind of patching from eg. widescreen patches, etc.

## Cfg7
No less no more, cfg7 is just count of cfg8 config sets. Single set is 3 x 4 bytes of data.

## Cfg8
This config holds Original Xbox memory patch description. It seems that only code patching is available, but data patch is untested.

Config data is 3 x 4 bytes and fields are:
1. Address to be patched
2. Patch size (1/2/4 supported)
3. Patch hex

Since patch hex is always 4 bytes we need to fill upper bytes with 00. For example if we want to patch single byte at address 0x12345 to 0xC3, patch size will be 0x00000001 and patch hex will be 0x000000C3.
