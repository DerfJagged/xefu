## Overview
Configs 07 and 08 are responsible for patching x86 code at runtime. Emulator use this to fix some issues, but community may known that kind of patching from eg. widescreen patches, etc.

## Cfg7
No less no more, cfg7 is just count of cfg8 config sets. Single set is 3 x 4 bytes of data.

## Cfg8
This config contains Original Xbox memory patch description. It seems that only code patching is available, but data patch is untested.

Config data is 3 x 4 bytes and fields are:
1. Address to be patched
2. Patch size (1/2/4 supported)
3. Patch hex

Since patch hex is always 4 bytes we need to fill upper bytes with 00. For example if we want to patch single byte at address 0x12345 to 0xC3, patch size will be 0x00000001 and patch hex will be 0x000000C3.

## More Info
On example below you can see what official patch for Kung Fu Chaos does. Pictures describe first half of patch only, second part do exactly the same thing, just on different address.

```
   CONFIG 7/8 data:
    patch count: 0x00000004
    patch XBE addr: 0x0015DF0F | patch size: 1 byte(s) | patch hex: 0xFF <---
    patch XBE addr: 0x0015DF17 | patch size: 1 byte(s) | patch hex: 0x8D <---
    patch XBE addr: 0x0015DF69 | patch size: 1 byte(s) | patch hex: 0xFF
    patch XBE addr: 0x0015DF71 | patch size: 1 byte(s) | patch hex: 0x8C
```

Like you can see, by editing two bytes patch redirect call to different function, and adjust agrument to be passed on stack instead of in esi, because that's how newly pointed function take args.
